# Reel and Meal

This project simulates what it is like in a work evironment to collaborate with fellow team members.  With the current knowledge acquired up to this point of the course, we are receiving a movie title and using the  OMDB API to determine the genre of the movie.   Once the genre is known  than an association table is used to determine a food type which is then entered into the Edmam API.  The results entail 4 possible recipes that the user can choose to cook a meal with.
