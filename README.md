# Reel and Meal

# Description

This project simulates what it is like in a work evironment to collaborate with fellow team members. With the current knowledge acquired up to this point of the course, we are receiving a movie title and using the OMDB API to determine the genre of the movie. Once the genre is known than an association table is used to determine a food type which is then entered into the Edmam API. The results entail 4 possible recipes that the user can choose to cook a meal with.

# Features
